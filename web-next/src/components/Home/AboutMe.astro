        Back in 2016, I decided to make a big change, switching from studying criminology to diving into the exciting
        world of Information Technology. That's when I discovered my passion for software development.

    <p class="mb-4">
        Now, with over <strong>{new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} years of experience as a software developer</strong>,
        I've had the chance to work in a constantly changing field, collaborating with other coding enthusiasts and
        contributing to some amazing projects.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>I'm all about the details</strong>, whether it's writing efficient code or perfecting a recipe. I
        believe that paying attention to the little things is key to building scalable, engaging, and accessible digital
        experiences.

        When I'm not coding, I like to mix things up. You might find me strumming my guitar (I'm no rockstar, but it's
        fun!), reading a good book, going for walks, doing home workouts, enjoying a good meal, playing PUBG Mobile or
        ML with friends, or just learning something new.
