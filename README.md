###  üëî About Me

Back in 2016, I decided to make a big change, switching from studying criminology to diving into the exciting world of Information Technology. That's when I discovered my passion for software development.

Now, with over 6+ years of experience as a software developer, I've had the chance to work in a constantly changing field, collaborating with other coding enthusiasts and contributing to some amazing projects.

I'm all about the details, whether it's writing efficient code or perfecting a recipe. I believe that paying attention to the little things is key to building scalable, engaging, and accessible digital experiences.

When I'm not coding, I like to mix things up. You might find me strumming my guitar (I'm no rockstar, but it's fun!), reading a good book, going for walks, doing home workouts, enjoying a good meal, playing PUBG Mobile or ML with friends, or just learning something new.
